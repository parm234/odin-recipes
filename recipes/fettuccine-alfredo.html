    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TThis is a recipe that I created by modifying my mother's recipe. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur and he scrapes the pan every time!<br> I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health conscious. Enjoy! </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat.</li>
        <li>PAdd salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</li>
